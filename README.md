## Description

Programming Language Suggester is a form application for people interested in coding, or expanding their horizons, to decide which language they should learn first. The suggester does not account for all programming languages, or all the most popular. Five languages were selected arbitrarily.

## Setup

This project will not be accepting pull requests, but you may fork the project for your own use.

To fork this project, go to the [repository page](https://github.com/SmKou/programming-language-suggester) and towards the top-right corner, click **Fork**. The page will reload the repo to a form for creating a forked repo. Make sure under **Owner*** that your Github avatar and name are selected, and you may rename the repo if you like under **Repository Name***. By default the option to copy only the MAIN or DEFAULT branch will be selected. Since pull requests will not be accepted, whether you keep this option checked or not will be up to you. Then click Create Fork. You will be taken to the repo page for your the new addition to your repositories. To work on it locally, you will clone it like any other project.

To keep your forked repo up to date with any updates I make to the repo, use: 

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/SmKou/programming-language-suggester.git
```

If you find that you need to remove the upstream, use:

```bash
git remote rm upstream
```

However, I suggest checking that there is an upstream first with:

```bash
git remote -v
```
