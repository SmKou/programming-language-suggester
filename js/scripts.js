The language provides low-level functionalities, being fast and easy to compile with direct mapping to machine code. It does all this with minimal runtime support.

The advantages of C are its portability, the object-oriented structure (but for only C++), and functional libraries. It is the language for developing console games and operating systems. On the other hand, the concept of pointers is very complicated and with the wrong application causing possible system failure, there are security issues with that. Also, unlike other popular languages, C does not have a garbage collector. The most notable users of C as their main, or one of their main programming languages, are everywhere like Adobe, Microsoft, Apple, Microsoft, and Mozilla.

There are numerous supersets that have become popular to address its flexibility and advances in web protocols and encryption to address. Since JavaScript runs in the browser, it also requires additional testing to make sure an app or website renders smoothly on all major browsers. The most notable users of JavaScript as their main, or one of their main programming languages, are Google, PayPal, Groupon, and Walmart.

The downsides, however, are that it executes slower than C and C++, and to improve its speed requires coding performance-critical modules in C or C++ and using them in Python.
